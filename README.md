# Custom Element Reactions diagram

An interactive version for [**Custom Element Reactions**](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-reactions) adapted from awesome [interactive react-lifecycle-methods-diagram](https://andyogo.github.io/custom-element-reactions-diagram/) and originally inspired by awesome [React Lifecycle Methods diagram tweeted by Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509). Built in React, obviously.

I did my best to make the diagram fully accessible, both for keyboard navigation and screen readers for visually impaired people.

[Online version](https://andyogo.github.io/custom-element-reactions-diagram/) is also available!

## How to use the diagram

* Click any method name to read its official spec (opens in a new tab).
* Methods in **bold** are the most common ones.
* Actions that are not methods, but otherwise help reading the diagram, are in *italics*.

## Collaboration

You are welcome to raise issues and create pull requests.

Particularly valueable contributions are those regarding [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i18n) as I only know so many languages. Adding new locale is pretty easy, but there's a [separate i18n guide](/src/i18n/README.md) in case you get lost.

You can also add a new version of the diagram in case React lifecycle methods are changed. There is a [separate versions guide](/src/versions/README.md) in case you get lost.
